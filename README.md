# Georgian to English Name Converter

This program is a simple web application that converts Georgian names to their English equivalents. It uses PHP and JavaScript to achieve the conversion and allows you to copy the converted name to the clipboard.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Upload the files to your web server, or you can use a local server environment like XAMPP or WAMP to run the application locally.

## How to Use

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. You will see a text input field labeled "Enter Georgian Name."
3. Type or paste the Georgian name you want to convert into the input field.
4. Click the "Convert" button to convert the Georgian name to its English version.
5. The converted English name will be displayed below the input field.
6. Click the "Copy text" button to copy the converted name to your clipboard.

## Important Notes

- The conversion uses an approximate transliteration from Georgian to English, as some Georgian letters do not have a direct one-to-one mapping with English letters.
- The first letters of both the first name and last name are capitalized in the converted output.
- The program works for Georgian names in the format "სახელი გვარი" (first name and last name).
- If the Georgian name contains characters that are not part of the Georgian alphabet, the conversion may not be accurate.

## Dependencies

- PHP (server-side processing)
- JavaScript (client-side processing)
- Web server or local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP)
